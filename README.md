# A Blank WordPress Theme

This WordPress theme is intentionally blank and serves a single purpose. Imagine the following scenario:

As a security precaution, and to prevent unnecessary updates, a WordPress developer has removed all the default WordPress themes, leaving him/her with just the single theme he/she is using/developing. The developer then realises that in order to test a [theme activation](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/after_switch_theme) plugin, he/she needs another theme. Doh.

This blank theme enables to the developer to quickly switch between themes, without any security risks, or any unnecessary updates.
